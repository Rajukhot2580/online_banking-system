Online Banking 

1. Introduction
•	Purpose: The purpose of this SRS document is to define the requirements for an Online Banking System. The system will enable users to perform banking operations such as account management, fund transfers, bill payments, and more through a secure and user-friendly web interface.
•	Scope: This project involves the development of a web-based Online Banking System that will serve as a platform for customers to manage their finances online.
2. Overall Description
•	Product Perspective: The Online Banking System is intended to be a standalone web application that integrates with existing banking infrastructure to provide online services to customers.
•	Product Features:
o	User registration and login
o	Account management (view account details, transaction history, etc.)
o	Fund transfers (between own accounts, to other customers)
o	Bill payments and recurring payments setup
o	View and download account statements
o	Alerts and notifications via email
•	User Characteristics: The target users are bank customers with basic internet usage skills. The system should cater to users of varying technical proficiency.
•	Assumptions and Dependencies:
o	Users must have access to the internet and a compatible web browser.
o	The system will depend on the bank's existing core banking system for processing transactions and account management.
3. Functional Requirements
•	User Registration and Authentication
o	Users must be able to register using their email, phone number, and a secure password.
o	The system must support multi-factor authentication (MFA) for enhanced security.
o	Users must be able to log in using their registered credentials.
o	Password recovery functionality must be available.
•	Account Management
o	Users must be able to view their account balance, transaction history, and other details.
o	The system must allow users to manage multiple accounts.
•	Fund Transfers
o	Users must be able to transfer funds between their own accounts, to other users within the bank, and to external bank accounts.
o	The system must support setting up scheduled or recurring transfers.
•	Bill Payments
o	Users must be able to add billers and make payments directly from their accounts.
o	The system must allow users to set up recurring bill payments.
•	Account Statements
o	Users must be able to view and download their account statements in PDF format.
•	Alerts and Notifications
o	The system must send alerts and notifications for significant account activities (e.g., large withdrawals, low balance).
4. Non-Functional Requirements
•	Performance: The system should handle a minimum of 5000 concurrent users with minimal latency.
•	Security: The system must adhere to industry standards for online security, including data encryption, secure authentication, and protection against common threats (e.g., SQL injection, cross-site scripting).
•	Usability: The user interface must be intuitive, with a focus on ease of use. The system should be accessible to users with disabilities.
•	Scalability: The system architecture must allow for easy scaling to accommodate a growing number of users and transactions.
•	Availability: The system should be available 24/7 with minimal downtime. It should have an uptime of 99.9%.
•	Compliance: The system must comply with relevant banking regulations and standards, including data privacy laws (e.g., GDPR).
5. System Architecture
•	Frontend: Developed using modern web technologies such as ReactJS providing a responsive and interactive user interface.
•	Backend: Developed using a robust framework such as Spring Boot or Django, providing RESTful APIs for the frontend to interact with.
•	Database: A relational database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) will be used to store user and transaction data.
•	Security: Implementation of HTTPS, encrypted communication, and secure user authentication mechanisms (e.g., OAuth2, JWT).
6. Project Plan
•	Milestones:
o	Phase 1: Requirements gathering and system design
o	Phase 2: Development of core features (user registration, login, account management)
o	Phase 3: Development of fund transfer, bill payment, and statement generation features
o	Phase 4: Security implementation and testing
o	Phase 5: System integration, testing, and deployment
•	Deliverables:
o	A fully functional Online Banking System
o	Source code and system documentation
o	User manual and deployment guide
7. Acceptance Criteria
•	The system must meet all functional and non-functional requirements as outlined in this SRS.
•	All features must be tested and validated against the requirements.
•	The system must be deployed and functional within the specified project timeline.
